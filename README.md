# ResizePhoto - Hugo Mitsumori

- Language: ruby 2.4.1
- Framework: rails 5.1.4
- Database: mongodb 3.6.1

I implemented the webservice using Rails because it's the framework I'm most familiar with for building web applications, and I like it anyway, although I find it slower than Django/Python

I feel sorry for I coudn't implement the cucumber/rspec tests in time


- Setup (given ruby, rails and mongodb are installed):
	bundle install

	rake db:create

- Run
	mongod

	rails s

* By default, the local server can be accessed by browsing localhost:3000
